# ocrAI ü§ñ

---

üÜï **Enhanced OCR + AI Mode:**
The AI-corrected text is now embedded directly into the PDF, preserving the original layout and positioning within the document.

üìÑ **New Output Format in Full AI OCR Mode:**
The output is now a Markdown-formatted .txt file, structured with titles, subtitles, and page markers.
This file can be converted directly within the app to a clean, paginated PDF, making it ideal for tasks like translating books while preserving formatting and pagination.

ocrAI is a simple web app that combines Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to process and translate documents. It offers an intuitive interface with real-time feedback and emoji progress.

## Key Features

- **File Management** üì§  
  - Upload PDF or image files easily.
  - Files are saved with unique names to avoid overwrites.
  - Delete all files with one click (removes from both uploads and outputs).

- **OCR Processing Modes** üîç  
  - **OCR (Tesseract Only):**  
    Extracts text with Tesseract and embeds it into the PDF using OCRmyPDF. The TXT file contains the raw OCR output.
  - **OCR + AI (Tesseract + AI):**  
    Uses Tesseract to extract text, then sends it to Gemini AI for correction and formatting. The corrected text is embedded directly into the resulting PDF, and a TXT file is also generated.
  - **AI (Full AI OCR):**  
    Uses Gemini AI to process the document page by page. Generates a TXT file in markdown format (with page markers and structure). This TXT can be converted to a PDF using the **TXT to PDF** tool in the app.
  - All modes show real-time progress with emojis and run in the background.

- **TXT to PDF** üìù
  - Convert any TXT file (especially markdown from AI mode) to a clean, paginated PDF directly from the app.

- **Post-OCR Compression** üì¶
  - Optionally compress images in the resulting PDF.
  - Configure target DPI, JPEG/PNG format, and quality.
  - Keep original uncompressed PDF if desired.

- **Translation** üåê  
  - Translate PDF or TXT documents page by page.
  - Progress updates are displayed, and a TXT file with the final translation (including page markers) is generated.

- **Configuration** ‚öôÔ∏è  
  - Manage and add new Gemini AI models and languages.
  - Update or add custom prompts for OCR, correction, and translation.
  - Download or upload the complete configuration (prompts and models).

## How to Use the Application

1. **Upload and Process Files:**
   - Go to the **OCR** tab.
   - Select your file (PDF or image).
   - Choose one of the processing modes:
     - **OCR** (Tesseract Only)
     - **OCR + AI** (Tesseract + AI for correction and AI-embedded PDF)
     - **AI** (Full AI OCR, generates markdown TXT)
   - For AI modes, select the desired prompt.
   - Click **Upload and process** and watch the real-time progress.
   - If you used **AI** mode, you can convert the resulting TXT to PDF using the **TXT to PDF** tab.

2. **Translate Documents:**
   - Go to the **Translation** tab.
   - Upload a new file or select one from the list of processed files.
   - Choose the target language and translation prompt.
   - Click **Translate** and observe the progress as each page is processed.
   - The result is saved in a TXT file with page markers.

3. **View Processed Files:**
   - Go to the **Processed Files** tab.
   - Download or delete files (with confirmation prompts).

   **Note:** The Processed Files list is ordered from most recent to oldest (top = newest).

4. **Configure the Application:**
   - Go to the **Configurations** tab.
   - Add, edit, or delete custom prompts.
   - Manage Gemini models: add new models or delete existing ones.
   - Configure languages and download or upload the complete configuration.

5. **Convert TXT to PDF:**
   - Go to the **TXT to PDF** tab.
